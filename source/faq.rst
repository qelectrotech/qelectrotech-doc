What is QET?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| **QET** (QElectroTech) is a cross-platform free and open-source (FOSS) tool allowing you to create electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic drawings.
| These drawings are essential tools for Electricians and Electrical Engineers alike, allowing them to easily identify components and connections of a electrical circuit.

Why does </feature> isn't yet implemented?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contrary to proprietary drawing softwares, QET is a a hobby project created by `the QElectroTech Team <https://qelectrotech.org/contact.php>`_. 
As we are a small developer team, we sadly do not have the capacity to implement every feature that our users propose.

That said, if you have some experience in C programming or with `QT <https://doc.qt.io/>`_ and are willing to implement a feature for QET, please do. 
We welcome contributions and have a `dedicated entry <developer/index>`_ in the documentation explaining you how to setup a dev environment.
