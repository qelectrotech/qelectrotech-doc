What is QET?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| **QET** (QElectroTech) is a cross-platform free and open-source (FOSS) tool allowing you to create electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic drawings.
| These drawings are essential tools for Electricians and Electrical Engineers alike, allowing them to easily identify components and connections of a electrical circuit.

Why does </feature> isn't yet implemented?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contrary to proprietary drawing software, QET is a a hobby project created by `the QElectroTech Team <https://qelectrotech.org/contact.php>`_. 
As we are a small developer team, we sadly do not have the capacity to implement every feature that our users propose.

That said, if you have some experience in C programming or with `QT <https://doc.qt.io/>`_ and are willing to implement a feature for QET, please do. 
We welcome contributions and have a `dedicated entry <developer/index>`_ in the documentation explaining you how to setup a dev environment. 

How long has QET been in existence?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project began in October 2006 in the form of small experiments. 
However, due to the development team's other involvement in OSS, the project's time estimation isn't very precise.

When is the next version of QElectroTech scheduled for release?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although one of the mottos of open source software is “Release early, release often,” the development team takes the time to fine-tune the software before each release. 
As a result, it no longer even attempts to set a target date (which would inevitably be missed) for the next release. 
The next version of QElectroTech will therefore be released “When it's done.”
