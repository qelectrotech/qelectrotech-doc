============================================
Contributing to the QET source code
============================================

The goal of this page is to teach you basics about the QET source code and how to contribute effectively to the project.

Access the source code
======================

To contribute to QElectroTech (QET), you need to have access to the `source code`_.

Source control is provided by `Git`_.

If you need help to setup or use Git, please take a look at the `Git Documentation`_.

Access the code documentation
=============================

To better understand the QET code base, you can read the `code documentation`_ generated by `doxygen`_. 

This documentation is kept up-to-date by an action running on the upstream repository. If you however want to generate and read it locally, `clone`_ it and run the command :code:`doxygen Doxyfile` at the root of the created directory. 

Compile the app from source
===========================

To set up a dev environment and compile the app locally, please refer to the :doc:`Build Guidelines<build>`.

Submit code
==================

To add your additions to the QET codebase, you need to open a `Merge Request`_ in the `source code`_ Git repository. This section will teach you the syntax used in the project and some basic guidelines when contributing.

Coding Style Setup
------------------

.. note::
  Make sure to follow the QET Coding style before submitting code.


#. First you'll want to download the corresponding :download:`XML file <../_external/_snippets/qtcreator-qet-style.xml>`.

#. Second, you'll need to import it into the QT Creator IDE. To do this, follow those steps:

   - Go to the "Project" tab and click on the "Code Style" element in the list.

   - Click on the "Import" button and select the XML file.

   - Select the "QET" Code Style in the dropdown

Do & Don't of contributing
--------------------------

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 35, 35
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Do
     - Don't
   * - After forking the repository, please **create another branch** for your changes. This will allow you to go back if something in the code breaks.
     - Don't use :code:`git pull` when updating your MR, prefer :code:`git rebase`. This will apply all the latest changes and make the commit history more readable, facilitating testing.  
   * - Structure your files so later contributors can easily make changes and additions to your files
     - Don't submit `spaghetti code`_. Unmaintainable code is a burden for users, maintainers and future developers.
   * - Always add function descriptions for `doxygen`_. This allows documentation to be updated when you push your additions
     - Do not submit undocumented code. It makes it tough for maintainers and future contributors to keep track of your features.

If you need help regarding building, compiling the app or more insight in the codebase, you can ask help on the `QET Forum`_.
