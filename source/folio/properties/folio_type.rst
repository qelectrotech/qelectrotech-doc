====================
Folio conductor type
====================

The **Type** tab from folio properties PopUP window allows pre-defining the `type of conductor`_ that 
will be drawn in the folio later. The `conductor properties`_ can also be pre-defined. This action 
avoid defining individually the conductor type and the common properties for each conductor created 
in the folio.
