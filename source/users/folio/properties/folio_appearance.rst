Folio conductor appearance
==========================

The **Appearance** tab from folio properties PopUP window allows pre-defining the `conductor appearance`_ 
of the conductors that will be drawn in the folio later. If all conductors from the folio should have the 
same appearance, this action avoid defining individually the `conductor appearance`_.
