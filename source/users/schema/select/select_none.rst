Select none
=============

To be sure that any object is selected before any action, QElectroTech provides the option to unselect 
all objects from the `workspace`_. This option is useful for avoiding undesired changes such as the 
`properties from an element`_.

The unselecting of objects can only be done from `menu bar`_. 

1. Select **Edit > Select none** to unselect all selected object.
