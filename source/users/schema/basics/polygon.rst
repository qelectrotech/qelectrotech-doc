Create polygon
###############

.. note::

    To draw more easily, the folio grid can be displayed from **Display > Display the grid** or 
    from `toolbar`_ icon |grid|. 

The polygon can only be added to the `workspace`_ by `toolbar`_.

    1. Select the icon |polygon| from the `toolbar`_ to add a polygon.
    2. Draw connected lines by simple click on the beginning and end point from each line.
    3. Doble Click on the end vertex/point from the polygon.

.. |polygon| image:: ../../images/ico/22x22/polygon.png

.. note::

    At everytime from the polygon creation, the previous line can be deleted without stopping the creation 
    process. 
   
        * Right click will delete the previous line without losing all previous work.

.. note::

   If the `toolbar`_ is not displayed, it can be displayed from **Settings > Display > Add**.

Polygon properties
##################

A polygon is a plane figure generated by a finite number of line segments connected. When 
the initial and end line segments from the polygon are connected, the polygon defines a closed area.

When the polygon do not define a closed area, the properties from the polygon object are the same as a `line object`_.

When the poligon defines a closed area, the **Closed polygon** check button from the polygon 
properties panel is selected, the polygon object has the same propertias as a `rectangle object`_.

.. note::

   If the initial and the end line segments from the polygon are not connected when the **Closed polygon** check button 
   is selected, a new line segment which connects both segments will be automatically generated.

The polygon properties can be displayed from `menu bar`_, by right click on one polygon edge/line, 
from selection properties panel and using keyboard shortcut.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1. Select one of the edges/lines from the polygon which should be edited.
    2. Select **Edit > Edit the selected object** menu item to display the polygon properties PopUP window.

Polygon properties from selection properties panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1. Select one of the edges/lines from the polygon which should be edited and the properties from the polygon will appear at `selection properties panel`_.

Polygon properties using keyboard shortcut
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QElectroTech allows using keyboard shortcut to increase the working efficiency.

    1. Select one of the edges/lines from the polygon which should be edited.
    2. Press ``Ctrl + e`` to display the polygon properties PopUP window.

    For more information about QElectroTech keyboard shortcuts, refer to `menu bar`_ section.

Add new point to polygon
########################

    1. Right click on the place from the edges/lines of the polygon where the new porint should be created.
    2. Select the option **Add a point** to create the new point at the polygon.

Delete point to polygon
#######################

    1. Right click on the point from the polygon which should be deleted.
    2. Select the option **Delete this point** to delete the point from the polygon.
