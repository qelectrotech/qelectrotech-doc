QElectroTech draws by default a `conductor`_ minimizing the horizontal and vertical lines. 
Changing the route of the `conductor`_ for a clear understanding of the `schema`_ is some times necessary. 
QElectroTech allows modifying the route.

To modify the route of a `conductor`_:

1. `Select the conductor`_ which route should be modified.
2. Press on a control point, blue points, from the `conductor`_ selected.
3. Without releasing the control point, displace the control point horizontally or vertically until desired position.
