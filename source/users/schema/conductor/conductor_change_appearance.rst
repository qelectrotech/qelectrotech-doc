============================

QElectroTech allows changing the `conductors appearance`_, the line style and color can be defined 
for each `conductor`_. 

To change the conductor appearance:

1. `Select the conductor`_ which should be edited. 
2. `Display conductor properties`_ PopUp window.
3. Go to **Appearance** tab.

4. Choose the desired parameters for main color and secondary color if necessary.
5. Click the check button **Apply properties to all conductor of this potential** if the changes should be applied for all `conductor`_ with common initial or end `terminal`_.
6. Click or unclick the option **Apply properties to all conductors of this potential**.
7. Press **OK** button to save and apply the property changes.
