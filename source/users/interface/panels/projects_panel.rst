The projects panel displays the opened projects trees, `folios`_ and `embedded title blocks`_. The `QET`_ and 
`user`_ collection title blocks are also displayed at the projects panel.

To display or hidden the projects panel:

    1. Select **Settings > Display > Projects** menu item.

The tasks which can be done from projects panel are:

    * Manage `folios`_ (Add folios, define folio order at each project, etc.).
    * Manage the `embedded title blocks`_ from the project.
    * Manage the default `QET`_ title block collection.
    * Manage the `user`_ title block collection. 
    * Define the active project.
    * Define the active folio which should be displayed at the `workspace`_.
    * Display the folio properties PopUP window.
    * Display the project properties PopUP window.

To make easier the work with the project panel, QElectroTech provides a filter. All `folios`_, 
`projects`_ and `title blocks`_ without a name or part of a string can be hidden.
