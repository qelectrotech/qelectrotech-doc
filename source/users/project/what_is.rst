==================
What is a project?
==================

The term project inside QElectroTech can be assimilated to a "database". A project is not a common database,
it is a collection of information which is not structured in columns and rows.

   Figure: QElectroTech project structure

A project is a group of `folios`_, `elements`_ and `conductors`_ represented inside the `folios`_ with the respective 
properties, properties which define the way how should be represented each folio 
(`title block`_, dimensions, etc.), properties which define how the reports should be represented (folio index, component list, connector 
list, etc.), properties which define how to export or print the information, interconnection relation 
between `elements`_ from the same or different `folios`_ and the master data (project name, author, year of 
creation, revision, etc.). 

The project is the base of QElectroTech to manage a work. The development team has focus the tasks on 
the electrical and control filed, even so, QElectroTech is a E-CAE software. For this reason, QElectroTech 
is an inter-disciplinary tool that allows the user to create many type of projects.

* Electrical projects: Purely electrical systems
* Automation projects: GRAFCET, diagrams, etc. 
* Fluid power projects: Hydraulic, pneumatic and central lubrication systems
* Process control projects: Process Industrial Diagrams (PID)
